#Building Netflix from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context, Portals), Firebase, Compound & Styled Components (10 Hour Tutorial Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_EEwGe-a9o)

I built this Netflix clone application from the 10-hour tutorial by Karl Hadwen in this README's title. I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage. There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

I used compound components (just a design pattern) to build my components, and there's over 10 examples as to how these are used. The styling is all handled via styled components. There's a bit of mixed syntax from older versions of Firebase and newer, but everything works as planned.
